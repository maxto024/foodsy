### Fixtures folder
All Json Mock  API responses are housed here.

Since Mock is used offline all image will be saved locally in Image folder and  imported as required in theme folder Images.js


These Json Mock can be used for several reasons.  _E.G._:
* To quickly test API parsing in unit tests
* To separate Network from Data concerns while coding
